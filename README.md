# Work-Day-Scheduler

This project is titled "Work Day Scheduler" and is an application users may utilize to plan out their work day. It is based off of a 9am-5pm work schedule and allows users to type in goals to complete thoughout their day. When the save button is clicked, the user can refresh the page and the text they had previously typed will remain. The current date is displayed at the top of the page using moment.js and as the day goes on, the hourly timeblocks will change colors depending on whether it is past, present, or future. HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript were needed to make this application.
